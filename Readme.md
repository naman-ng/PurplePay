Tried best to keep the UI neat and clean

To make the UX good - focused on the basic HCI principles and showing loader in every transaction.

As the code was really small didnt focus on making components.

Easily addable features -
1. Withdraw function
2. Show fees collected for different tokens seperately

Advance features -
1. Show every user all the current investement he has made in different tokens
